This tool uses the `codeql` binary. That tool can communicate with GitHub servers to perform its functions - in this case, to download required language packs.

The `help <keyword>` function uses the same service as used by the [CodeQL docs website](https://codeql.github.com/docs/), which is hosted by [AddSearch](https://www.addsearch.com/) and subject to their [privacy notice](https://www.addsearch.com/privacy/).
